  </div>
  <div class="text1-div">
      <p class="text1">At Flourist, we work exclusively with Canadian family farms to source premium local grains and beans. Then we stone mill the grain in-house, to order. We're a women-owned and operated small business based on the unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Slílwta/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh), and xmkʷy̓m (Musqueam).</p>

        <h4 class="div2-text">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h4>
        <h2 class="div2-text">Traceable food is trustworthy food.</h2></div>
        <div class="p-text">
        <p class="div2-text">Flourist was co-founded in 2013 by Janna Bishop and Shira McDermott, a clothing designer and food industry pro respectively, to fill what they saw as a gap in the growing farm to table movement, and to provide transparency in a whole new, untouched food category.</p>

        <p class="div2-text">We focus on grains because that’s where we can make the most impact — it’s a cornerstone of kitchens globally. Grains allow us to go big, to give a lot of people access to high quality, nourishing food. Traceable food is trustworthy food.</p>

        <p class="div2-text">Our vertically-integrated supply chain connects Canadian farmers directly to people who value quality. Together, we're creating food security for future generations.</p></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text2-div">
      <p class="text2">A healthy community is built on healthy food. And healthy food depends on how it’s grown, harvested and prepared. We think the question “where did your food come from?” is one each of us should be able to answer.</p>

  <div class="div3">

        <div class="h2-h4-text">
        <h4 class="div3-text">EDIBLE TRANSPARENCY</h4>
        <h2 class="div3-text">Connection</h2></div>
        <div class="p-text">
        <p class="div3-text">We connect farmers to the people they feed in a way no one else has before. We give a human face to the cornerstone of our diets and forge a bond between people and the food they eat most often. We help people get curious about where their food comes from and make informed choices about what they’re consuming. This isn't about nameless, faceless bulk bins at the grocery store.</p>

        <p class="div3-text">When you purchase from Flourist you are not only making better food choices for yourself, but you are supporting a small Canadian business that cares about creating a better food system for all. We're a small group of millers, bakers, and content creators intent on doing our part to ensure a better collective food future.</p>

    <div class="text3-div">
        <p class="text3">We share the tools, education and community people need to access, cook and eat nutritious, whole food. And the more people crave traceable grains, the more family farmers we can partner with. The more we pursue high quality plant-based ingredient options, the better for the environment, and for our collective long term health and sustainability.</p>

            <div class="p-text">
            <p class="div4-text">We don't add anything to our flours other than the organic grains we mill to create them. Our sifted flours are perfect for re-creating your favourites with zero compromise on quality. We encourage experimenting with whole grain flours to benefit from the fullness of what whole grains have to offer, from the flavour to the nutrition.</p>
    
            <p class="div4-text">Our customer reviews say it all, especially for those who have struggled with conventionally produced flours. Discover the difference freshness makes.</p></div>
